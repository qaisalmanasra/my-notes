My Name is Qais ALMasnasra, I'm 25 Years old, I've graduated from Girne American University as an Energy Systems Engineer

From [How to Learn Things Fast Without Going Crazy ](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-learn-things-fast-without-going-crazy) material, I've learnt the following:

**-there is a procedure when it comes to learn something new:**
*1- try to find videos that is short, easy and have the full picture of what you are trying to learn.*
*2- try to practise by your own.*
*3- read the desired documentation*

**-there is some notes that you must be aware of:**
*1- try to avoid tutorials, and long content.*
*2- try to be creative as much as you can when you practise, so dont copy paste what you've learnt and make changes even if its unnoticeable.*
*3- try to be up to date.*
